# 📘 Midnight Developers Technical Documentation Page

## 📖 Overview
This project is part of my FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification.
The objective was to build a technical documentation page using only HTML and CSS.

The goal of this Technical Documentation Page is to help beginner developers understand the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. The page provides clear instructions and code examples that explain how to create a basic HTML structure and properly link a CSS file, which are essential first steps in web development. The documentation includes a fixed navigation menu positioned on the left for desktop screens, allowing users to jump between sections and learn each step in sequence. On smaller screen sizes, the navigation layout adjusts and moves to the top of the page to maintain readability and usability. Topics covered include setting up the document structure, adjusting layouts for different screen sizes, and understanding key elements such as the `<head>`, `<body>`, and `<main>` sections.

## ✨ Features
- Fixed side navigation bar for quick access to sections.
